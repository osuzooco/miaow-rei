# CLI Shell Script Exercise Repo

This repository contains several Bash shell scripts created as part of my learning journey with CLI tools and scripting.  
It is not intended for production use, but rather as an exercise and personal practice space.

## Contents

- `aka.sh` — Color Choice Example.
- `haiyushu.sh` — Simple text-based game.
- `himom.sh` — Command guidance tool.
- `kaka.sh` — Interactive welcome script.
- `mishuu.sh` — Directory listing utility.
- `error.js` — Error showing in teh JS Console (not complex)
- -`.oops.sh` — Error showing in WSL, Git Bash, Linux, etc... (in bash)

## Purpose

This repo is **educational** and for **practice** purposes only.  
Scripts may be incomplete, experimental, or not optimized.  
Feel free to use as a reference or for your own learning.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Linux, macOS (or WSL on Windows), and Bash installed.  
Run any script with:

```bash
./script_name.sh
```

You may need to make them executable first:

```bash
chmod +x script_name.sh
```
